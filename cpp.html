				<ul>
					<li>What Are Cookies and How Do We Use Them ? - Our properties (website, mobile application, social media pages and other digital presence we may have) use a browser feature known as a cookie, which itself does not contain personal information, although it will enable us to relate your use of our properties to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive. Information collected from cookies is used by our properties to evaluate their effectiveness, analyze trends, and administer the Sites. The information collected from cookies allows us to determine such things as which parts of our properties are most visited and difficulties our visitors may experience in accessing the Sites. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on our properties by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and information, as well as by resolving difficulties. In addition, our properties use cookies to help keep track of Promotions you view and to tell us whether you have visited our properties in the past. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive a warning message with each cookie.
					</li>
					<li>Third Party Cookies - We use third-party service provider(s) to assist us in better understanding the use of our properties. Our service provider(s) will place cookies on your computer and will receive information that we select that will inform us of things such as how visitors navigate around our properties, identify which features are most used, identify which Promotions are browsed, and aggregate information. Our service provider(s) analyzes this information and provides us with aggregate reports. The information and analysis provided by our service provider(s) will be used to assist us in better understanding our visitors' interests in the Sites and how to better serve those interests. The information collected by our service provider(s) may be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you while you are visiting our properties.
					</li>
					<li>Additionally, if you have visited our mobile website or activated one of our mobile-device applications, and if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Location Information, we will collect that automatically. If we associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Policy governs how we would use that information too.
