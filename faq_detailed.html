			<p>All rewards on CartPerk are cash back offers. The rules of an offer may vary over time and are decided by the manufacturer. For example, you may get a reward on first purchase, first 2 purchases or even higher reward for purchasing the same product for 6 months. All of these rules are decided by the manufacturers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">How do I get the reward on CartPerk?</p>
			<p>You will have to first make the purchase of the products under offer at one of the <a href="supportedretailers.html">CartPerk supported retailers</a> and collect your receipt. Then, you are required to upload the receipt using the CartPerk app. You will be entitled to the applicable cash back once the bill is validated.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">How do I know if there are new rewards?</p>
			<p>We intend to publish new rewards once a week on every Friday. However, there may be some exceptions. We will notify you whenever there are new rewards relevant to you.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">How do I know more about a reward?</p>
			<p>Please click on the offer to view the offer detail screen. All the details of a particular offer can be seen on this screen.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">Do I need to submit the complete receipt?</p>
			<p>Yes, only receipts that are complete are deemed to be valid. Please make sure to capture the whole receipt.</p> 
			<!--For example, show an image of a valid receipt and an invalid receipt.- TODO-->
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">My receipt is very long. How do I scan it?</p>
			<p>You can scan long receipts in multiple instalments. You will notice a <b class="brand-color">+</b> icon on the receipt upload screen. You will need to click on that icon for uploading the new instalment. You can upload the receipt in multiple parts till you have scanned the whole receipt.</p>
		</div>		
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">How long does it take for you to validate a receipt?</p>

		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">Can I submit unlimited number of receipts every month?</p>
			<p>Typically, most of us would not visit a store more than 6-8 times a month. Please make sure you are submitting valid receipts from all your purchases. Our system will try to identify abnormal activities and may reject some bills if we find them to be unacceptable.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">There are times when I buy a few items at local supermarket. Should I submit those receipts too? Why should I submit all my grocery receipts every month?</p>
			<p>Like we said, more we know you the better we can serve you and ensure you get better offers. In addition to that, we will be launching additional incentives for receipt submissions wherein some consumers may get additional rewards.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">Can I submit hand written receipts?</p>
			<p>We do not accept hand written receipts. Only printed receipts are accepted on CartPerk. You must buy the product in a store that provides a computerized sales receipt with the name of the store, clear product details (like a dedicated product line with the name of the product), and the date and time of the purchase. Please refer to the list of <a href="supportedretailers.html">CartPerk supported retailers</a></p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">What types of receipts can I submit?</p>
			<p>You can submit any grocery (food, personal care, home care etc) receipts. While we don’t accept any other receipts today, we intend to launch in other categories at a later point.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">Can I avail CartPerk offers in a retail store?</p>
			<p>No, all offers published on CartPerk are exclusive for CartPerk consumers. We will notify the amount you can redeem once the receipt has been validated.</p>
			<p>Your retailer may not be aware of the offers on CartPerk, so you may not need to check with them. Please make your purchase at one of the <a href="supportedretailers.html">CartPerk supported retailers</a>. Come home, sit back and upload the receipt to avail the cash back.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">How can I redeem my earnings?</p>
			<p>You can redeem your cash back as mobile recharge. If you have earned a cash back of Rs 100, your mobile number or any other mobile number of your choice can be recharged with that amount upon redemption. A pre-paid customer would receive additional recharge for that amount and a bill payment for that amount would be paid for a post-paid customer. Recharge is subject to terms and conditions of your operator and plan you may be subscribed to.</p>
			<p>We intend to provide you with other redemption options in future.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">I have a post-paid account and do not want to have multiple payments made to my account. Instead, can I have CartPerk pay into my mobile account on a monthly basis?</p>
			<p>Yes, the choice of when to redeem is completely left to you. You accumulate your cash back earnings and redeem all of that once a month.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">How does CartPerk get better if I use it more?</p>
			<p>The more we know about you, the more we will try to tailor our offers from manufacturers. In the process, you will received more personalized offers over time.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="legalsection">
		    <p class="heading">There is an offer running on a product at a retailer. Can I still avail a cashback on it from CartPerk?</p>
			<p>As far as possible, we will strive to ensure that the rewards that you get on CartPerk are exclusive. Typically, there would be no other promotion running on the products that are on reward on CartPerk. However, if there is an offer already running and your receipt captures that offer, we may not be able to give you the cash back. This is subject to the manufacturer's discretion.</p>
