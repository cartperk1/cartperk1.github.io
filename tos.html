Each Offer may be subject to Additional Terms and may be discontinued by CartPerk at any time. At any time and in CartPerk’s sole discretion, CartPerk may: (i) determine whether or not you are eligible to redeem an Offer; (ii) determine whether or not you have earned Rewards; or (iii) adjust your Rewards total.

Users shall not be eligible to earn these bonuses if they invite other users who share the same mobile device or if they create multiple accounts in an effort to earn referral bonuses for inviting themselves. Such actions violate these Terms of Use and shall be grounds for CartPerk to terminate a User’s account, rescind any referral bonuses, reverse or correct user Rewards balances, or take other actions as appropriate. Where a user cannot produce examples of how referrals have taken place, including screenshots of where referrals were made, CartPerk reserves the right to decline to award Referral Bonuses, rescind bonuses, demand repayment of Rewards credited, or take other remedial actions.
